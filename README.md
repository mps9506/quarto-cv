[![quarto-ext-chk](https://github.com/mps9506/quarto-cv/actions/workflows/check-extension.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/mps9506/quarto-cv/actions/workflows/check-extension.yaml)

A Quarto template for generating a CV in pdf format. The template is based entirely
on [Steven Miller's R Markdown templates](https://github.com/svmiller/stevetemplates).

## Installing

System Requirements:
- quarto >= 1.4
- latex

```bash
quarto install extension mps9506/quarto-cv
```

This will install the template for use with existing Quarto projects or documents.

*or* To install the extension and create an example qmd file and project (easiest way to start):

```bash
quarto use template mps9506/quarto-cv
```

If you need to use an old version of quarto, install a previous quarto-cv release:

```bash
quarto install extension mps9506/quarto-cv@v1.0.3
```

## Usage

To use with with quarto in the cli:

```bash
quarto render your_cv.qmd --to quarto-cv.pdf
```

or specify in the document yaml:

```yaml
format:
  quarto-cv-pdf: default
```

## Format Options

### Contact Block

The contact block at the top of the CV is rendered using the following metadata:

```yaml
author: First Name Last Name
address: Street, City, State, Country
# The following are optional
phone: your contact number
email: you@email.com
github: github account
orcid: orcid identfier
osf: five character osf id
twitter: twitter handle
web: web address (no `https://`)
```

### Bibliographies

The template includes a lua filter to easily incorporate multiple bibliographies using `.bib` files if you choose to manage publications this way. 
This is a good option for separating out book/chapter, journal articles, white papers, datasets, and software.

In the document yaml header simply point to your `.bib` files and provide a unique name:

```yaml
bibliography:
  peer: peer.bib
  reports: reports.bib
  books: books.bib
  software: software.bib
validate-yaml: false
```

Note, that the `validate-yaml` key must be false in quarto because it expects
a character value when it vaildates the yaml header.

Now create different bibliographies for each one:

```
# Journal Articles

::: {#refs-peer}
:::

# Software

::: {#refs-software}
:::
```

You can specify the bibliographic style using the csl variable. By default it points to an APA style sorted by descending date. Other styles can be found [here](https://www.zotero.org/styles).

### Fonts

The default font is EB Garamond. 
There are two primary methods for changing the font used. 
First you can use fonts provided through  various [LaTeX font packages](https://tug.org/FontCatalogue/about.html) using the `fontfamily:` yaml key.
The `fontfamilyoptions:` can optionally be used in conjunction to set the LaTeX font package option.
This is probably the easiest method if there is a package with the font you want to use.

```yaml
fontfamily: electrum
fontfamilyoptions: lf
```
The second option is to point the `mainfont:` yaml key to a locally installed font.

```yaml
mainfont: Ubuntu
```

Note that `fontfamily:` will override `mainfont:` so specify just one.

### Asian scripts

Support for Chinese, Japanese, and other Asian language characters are provided through the `xeCJK` package. The pdf will have to be rendered using xelatex instead of the default luatex:

```yaml
title: CV
format:
  quarto-cv-pdf:
    pdf-engine: xelatex
CJKmainfont: Noto Sans CJK JP
```

The `CJKmainfont:` yaml key should point to a locally installed font.
